% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.1 April 2013
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The successful operations of modern electric power infrastructure are dependent on a reliable and efficient communication network. Researchers and utility companies are exploring how software-defined networking (SDN) technology can enhance efficiency and resilience of the Smart Grid. This trend calls for a simulation-based platform that provides sufficient features and controllability for evaluating network application designs, as well as the facilitation of transitions from in-house research ideas to real systems. In this work, we present a hybrid distributed testing platform that combines a power distribution system simulator with a heterogeneous distributed embedded Linux system. This system supports distributed communication network emulation using real networking hardware to support high fidelity analysis of communication network applications and their impacts on the power systems. Our main contributions are two-fold, the first is in the design of a virtual time system for distributed Linux devices with precision controllability of the execution of the emulation systems. In other words, pausing and resuming any specified container processes in the perception of their own virtual clocks with minimal overhead. The second contribution is the efficient synchronization of the two virtual time based sub-systems.
